# **Reactive expressions** are a bit smarter than regular R functions. They cache their values and know when their values have become outdated. What does this mean? The first time that you run a reactive expression, the expression will save its result in your computerâ€™s memory. The next time you call the reactive expression, it can return this saved result without doing any computation (which will make your app faster).

# The reactive expression will only return the saved result if it knows that the result is up-to-date. If the reactive expression has learned that the result is obsolete (because a widget has changed), the expression will recalculate the result. It then returns the new result and saves a new copy. The reactive expression will use this new copy until it too becomes out of date.
